This project is the backend for a wallet app, built using the MERN stack. The major tech stack includes Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM. The backend handles authentication via JWT tokens, user data management, and transaction processing. MongoDB serves as the database, with Mongoose providing robust data modeling and validation. This backend is designed to be scalable and secure, forming a solid foundation for the wallet app.
